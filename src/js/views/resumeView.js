                <p><strong><em>Nokia – (Twango.com)</em></strong> • Bellevue, WA	Nov 2007 – Aug 2008</p>
                <p><strong>UI Web Application Developer</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Worked closely with a team of designers in the UK (AKQA) to redesign the look and feel of the old Twango site, and get it more in line with Nokia’s ovi.com theme.  This involved rebuilding, and re-skinning most of the sites .net controls, as well as building a new top bridge navigation bar, and a new main navigation bar. All of these UI enhancements completed the wrap-up of “sprint3”, and gave the site a look that matched the current direction that Nokia was going for with the ovi.com.</li>
                    <li>Built localized control prototypes, to do proof of concept for a lot of the Globalization and localization that would be implemented in further releases. These prototypes required a lot of researching methods and best practices to insure we built the site as robust as possible to handle any localized string scenario. </li>
                    <li>As part of a three person development team, we worked daily to develop a new web site framework that was fluid, flexible, globalized, and most of all robust across all browser clients, on both PC and MAC. The new framework was developed using a mixture of YUI(yahoo) and BluePrint (google), in a .net environment. Using the Scriptaculous JavaScript library we created a great set of user controls for the new site, that allowed for easier customer understanding, as well as visually impressive.</li>
                    <li>I was responsible for rebuilding the current bridge and main navigation. The idea was to make them flexible and fluid to fit the new design. I also took the liberty of converting this code into actual controls to simplify the master page, and reduce the amount of physical code on the page.</li>
                    <li>Led the design and development work on a new administration moderation tool. With our site giving open access to upload images and video, we needed a way to have media flagged and then the ability to have a 3rd party company go through the flagged media using this new admin moderation web tool.</li>
                    <li>Created, and updated functional specs for many of the tools we were building throughout our releases.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>My top requirement for this company was to insure that all of the ASP.NET/C# and AJAX controls, looked and functioned the same across all browsers. I was challenged with the task of finding creative workarounds for layout and inconsistency issues with these control objects when used in all browsers and OS(s).</li>
                    <li>Responsible for creating a seamless visual experience across all browsers and operating systems for users on the Infilearn web based software platform. Cross browser compatibility was a top concern as the web product was used worldwide. The idea behind the cross browser visual aspect of the product was the need for a consistency of identical  look and feel as to that of  a standalone executable application, but have it web based for the ability to grow and expand the product on a regular basis.</li>
                    <li>Worked towards a master page layout across the entire site for ease of updating and expanding. Being that the site was constructed off shore by a third party, and handed over to Infilearn, most of the functionality was in place, but the look in feel of the site was very scattered. Cleaned up and unified all pages and sections of the site to compliment the overall look and design of the product as a whole.</li>
